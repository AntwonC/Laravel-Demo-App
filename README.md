PHP files that I created: <br> 
<br>
resources/views/page.blade.php<br>
<br>
resources/views/layouts/layout.blade.php<br>
<br> 

SCSS file for the Form Page: <br> 
<br>
resources/main.scss<br>

The Laravel Framework handles most of the work for creating this website. 
With the help of node.js, we can easily install the dependencies that we need to apply our SCSS. 
Laravel also supports re-routing the HTML links to a different page. 

This web-app is a simple form which will send data to a database if it is connected. 

NOTE: You would need to locally host your own database for this to website to work. Something like XAMPP will work.
