Form Page<br>

PHP files that I created: <br> 
page.blade.php<br>
layout.blade.php 
<br> 

SCSS file for the Form Page: <br> 
main.scss<br>
<br> 

The Laravel Framework handles most of the work for creating this website. 
With the help of node.js, we can easily install the dependencies that we need to apply our SCSS. 
Laravel also supports re-routing the HTML links to a different page.
